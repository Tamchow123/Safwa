/**
 * Weakness persistence adapter (impure, BROWSER-ONLY) — the thin Dexie
 * wiring between the pure weakness modules (T1-T3) and the local learner
 * stores (Phase 13 §7, §30). Mirrors modules/analytics/persistence.ts: the
 * pure modules never import Dexie; this is the ONE place weakness analytics
 * are assembled end to end.
 *
 * REUSE, NOT A THIRD READER: this calls `readAnalyticsRawSnapshot` — the
 * SAME raw component/attempt/event read the dashboard/progress pages'
 * `readAnalyticsSnapshot` is built on — never a second/third independent
 * `study_attempts`/`review_events` scan implementation (that would risk Weak
 * Areas disagreeing with Dashboard/Progress about which rows are valid).
 * Deliberately the READ-ONLY variant: weakness analytics never reads
 * `dailyActivity`, so it must not pay for (or trigger) that cache's
 * clear+rewrite write on every call — this runs on the mixed/custom
 * session-start hot path, not just the dashboard, so an unconditional write
 * there would add IndexedDB traffic to the app's busiest entry points for a
 * result this module never consumes.
 * The component universe is joined once (`effectiveComponents`) per call,
 * exactly like the Phase 12 analytics load — the CALLER derives it once per
 * loaded release (`deriveAllComponents`, e.g. `useWeaknessSnapshot`'s
 * `useMemo`, mirroring `use-analytics-snapshot.ts`) and passes the result
 * in, so a visibility-refresh/retry never repeats that derivation pass.
 *
 * The clock instant is INJECTED by the caller — this adapter never invents
 * time.
